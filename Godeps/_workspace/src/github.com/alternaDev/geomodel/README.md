This project is an (incomplete) attempt at a Go implementation of the Pyhton geomodel project (cf. http://code.google.com/p/geomodel/ ).

As such, this project aims to provide a generalized solution for performing basic indexing and querying of geospatial data in Google App Engine.

At the core, this solution utilizes geohash-like objects called geocells. See the aforementioned project for details.
